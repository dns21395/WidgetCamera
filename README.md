Description
-----

I was wondering if the Android can take pictures without opening camera and decided to create this program. 

*Curiosity heh.*

RxJava, Dagger 2 really helped me to finish this program just for 2 days. 

Actually Android have to connect to the camera, but anyway visually it looks like that app can take pictures without opening camera. 

Select the resolution (default width=1920, height=1080)

Drag out app widget to home screen and tap it
<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dns21395/WidgetCamera/master/ReadmeFiles/widget.jpg" width="360" /></p>

Notification will notify you that app taking pictures
